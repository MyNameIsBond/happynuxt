## THP is growing

from the very beginning, it was ambitious. To even have one website let aside more than one.
I have been through a lot as a programmer and wanted to help people struggle less.

You might come and visit THP, or have been visiting for a while now. The purpose of this website is to teach about mobile and web development.

The way you will be learning in THP is by courses. I will be creating courses where you can read and learn more about professional programming.

## Subjects

THP will cover almost everything you need to know to create the best websites both front and back end. subjects like, SEO, clean programming, best practices, performance. You will learn how to program in a way to create a scalable and clean project.

## Technologies

THP will most of the time focus on mobile and web development as it is explained above. on the latest technologies such as Swiftui/Swift. We will cover hubrid technologies such as React Native and Flutter.

## Soft Skills

Soft skills are more important than you know. You are going to need them more than you think. I will also try to give you the best advice to be able to be a good programmer and someone where people would want to work with.
